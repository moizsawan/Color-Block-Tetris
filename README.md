# Color-Block-Tetris

Usage: 
Start the program by running runme.m in the MATLAB. A menu appears, which has the following buttons:
1)	Easy Tetris
2)	Hard Tetris
3)	Help
Click on the button you wish to use and begin. You must first click on the third button and get to know of how to play the game.

Options: 
The level of difficulty of the game depends upon what button you select. 
If you select ‘Easy Tetris’, then the game will run in such a way that you can move the block either left or right, without its y-component getting changed i.e. the block stays in the same row. This is comparatively easier to play, as can make the block settle anywhere you want to. You get a single point for one pop in this type.
If you select ‘Hard Tetris’, then the game will run in such a way that if you move the block either left or right, its y-component will decrease by one unit with a single keyboard input. This is comparatively harder to play as the blocks are already falling from random positions in the second row, and you can’t easily reach the desired destination. You get two points for one pop in this type.

Features: 
There is also a ‘Help’ button in the menu. This will display an image of instructions of how to play the game in a separate figure.
A pop sound is heard if the condition of three blocks together is met.
A pop image appears randomly in the grid if the condition of three blocks together is met. 
If you press ‘Enter’ on the keyboard, the game stops, and all the other figure close.
